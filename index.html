            <h2>About myself</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Abdulaziz, born and raised in Sana'a, Yemen. Picture this: a bustling household with 7 older siblings
                (yep, I'm the baby of the family), all now married with kids of their own. Growing up in Yemen shaped a big part of
                who I am today - the friendships, the culture, it's all part of my DNA.</p>
            <p>Life took an unexpected turn when the war started in 2015, and I found myself packing my bags for the US. Talk about
                a change of scenery! I dove headfirst into college life, choosing Software Engineering as my field (because who
                doesn't love solving puzzles?). It was during these college years that I met my ride-or-die friends - the ones
                who've seen me through late-night coding sessions and ultimate frisbee tournaments alike.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to now, and you'll find me in Seattle, crafting code for Amazon. It's a far cry from the streets of
                Sana'a, but hey, life's an adventure, right? Through it all, my Yemeni roots and my love for both cultures continue
                to shape my worldview and my dreams for the future.</p>


            <h2>About my future wife</h2>
            <p>When I think about my future wife, I envision a partner who's not just my better half, but my best friend and
                confidante. Here's what I'm looking for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A woman who loves Allah deeply and understands Islam, not just as a set of rules, but as a way of life that
                    guides and enriches our journey together.</li>
                <li>Someone who's social and outgoing, who can light up a room with her presence and make friends easily. I'm all
                    about building a strong community, and I'd love a partner who shares that passion.</li>
                <li>A family-oriented person who puts our family first, but also knows the importance of maintaining her own
                    identity and pursuits.</li>
                <li>An open-minded individual who's curious about the world and always eager to learn. I'm looking for someone who
                    can challenge me intellectually and grow with me.</li>
                <li>A woman with a great sense of humor - because life's too short not to share a good laugh every day.</li>
                <li>Someone who's ambitious and has her own goals, whether that's in her career, personal growth, or making a
                    difference in the community.</li>
                <li>A partner who's comfortable with both her cultural roots and the multicultural world we live in. Bonus points if
                    she's interested in learning about Yemeni culture!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately, I'm looking for a teammate in life - someone to share the joys, weather the storms, and build a beautiful
                future together, inshaAllah.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</h3>
                <p><strong>Family:</strong> I see myself married and have kids. I have a clear vision on how to educate
                    my kids and create a healthy environment for them to flourish and become productive.</p>
                <p><strong>Socially:</strong> My wife, kids and I are part of a big fun islamic community. We volunteer,
                    and do most of our activities in that community. I also see my house as the place where all family
                    friends like to be during events. Our family is the type of family that most of the neighbors know.
                    Also I would love to see myself giving back to Yemen. Help spread the knowledge I have and share
                    everything I could with them.</p>
                <p><strong>Career:</strong> Principal software engineer that helps form new ideas and bring them to
                    life. I have my own business on the side.</p>

                <h3>What do you look for in a girl?</h3>
                <p>In following order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Someone who matches my level of religiousness. Someone who's open
                        minded and not muslim just because they were born in a muslim house. Curious and like to learn.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Communication is a must have requirement in any relationship.
                        Thus, a girl that knows how to communicate effectively is crucial for marriage success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social:</strong> A wife that is social is a must have in my opinion. I like ladies who
                        know how to be active in a community and know how to make friends and stay active. Can manage to
                        be nice to the people I care about.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hospitable:</strong> This kinda overlaps with c, but again, I love to be around people,
                        and it's a requirement to have someone who loves to be hospitable to people too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ambitious:</strong> Someone who has goals. Someone that can set family and themselves to
                        success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun (must have):</strong> Someone who is advantageous. Like to try new things.
                        Appreciate music, art.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What do you do for a living?</h3>
                <p>I work for Amazon as a Software Engineer. I work mostly with artists and designers. My specific role
                    is to design tools that make their life easier and speed the process of producing interior designs.
                    Ironically, part of my job is to try to automate interior design so we can get rid of artists.</p>

                <h3>How do you resolve a conflict?</h3>
                <p>I normally like to assess what is the cause of a conflict before resolving it. Is it a temporary heat
                    caused by a stressful situation? Is it caused by miscommunication? Fear? Expectation? .. etc. If the
                    issue is not a life changing decision, then there are many ways to deal with it, not going to list
                    them in this doc. However, if the issue is a life changing situation then I do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sit and talk logically about it respecting the values that we both value. What does religion say
                        about it? If it's not religion related, what are the pros and cons? If that doesn't help, can I
                        compromise with no harm? .. etc</li>
                    <li>If the above doesn't work, then a third eye might help. I normally pick a person that we both
                        trust, and hope they bring a fresh idea, or help us see the correct choice.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What keeps you up at night?</h3>
                <p>When things go wrong with my family. I am the type of person who's calm at any incident unless it's
                    related to my family.</p>

                <h3>What do you enjoy most?</h3>
                <p>The reaction of someone who likes my food. Guess what I hate most?</p>

                <h3>Best movies and shows</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>GOT: my absolute favorite!!!</li>
                    <li>Fury Movie</li>
                    <li>Catch me if you can, wolf of wall street, Inception (or anything that Leonardo acts)</li>
                    <li>Forrest Gump</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Favorite Islamic scholar</h3>
                <p>No one, I normally like to seek answers myself. Or listen to multiple opinions and judge which
                    opinion I want to go with.</p>

                <h3>Favorite sports</h3>
                <div class="interests">
                    <span class="interest">Ultimate Frisbee</span>
                    <span class="interest">Hiking</span>
                    <span class="interest">Tennis</span>
                    <span class="interest">Pickleball</span>
                    <span class="interest">Paddle</span>
                </div>

                <h3>Cereal first or milk first?</h3>
                <p>I don't eat cereal. Prefer warm breakfast made with love.</p>

                <h3>What if things go south in a marriage?</h3>
                <p>With the world that we live in, and with a 53% divorce rate, it's very likely (may Allah forbid) that
                    I will end up there. Regardless, what matters to me is that if divorce happens, I do my absolute
                    best to end it on good terms. Easier said than done, but I will do everything I can to reduce the
                    blast radius and keep in mind that there are no winners and losers in a divorce.</p>

                <h3>What are your weaknesses?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes I'm a little impatient. But I've got to a really good point where I am always aware when
                    this issue comes up.</p>
